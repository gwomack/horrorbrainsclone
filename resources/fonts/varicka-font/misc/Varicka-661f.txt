Varicka (Truetype and Opentype with no OT features)

Based on 'Varick', from "Decorative Condensed Alphabets", by Dan Solo, Page 94.

Letter spacing is set to balance the letterforms themselves; the space between most adjacent letters is identical to the horizontal space inside such letters as 'O' and 'H'. Kerning is supplied as needed for certain letter combinations, particularly those that have a letter with a projection on the left, such as A, E, F, H, K, P, and R.

Varicka is superficially similar to Red Rooster's Triple Gothic Condensed, but the Solo book's font has different features and some very different letterforms.

This font is free and available for all use, personal and commercial, with no restrictions.
